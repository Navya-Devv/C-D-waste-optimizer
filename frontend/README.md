## 📌 Overview

**C&D Waste Optimizer** is a web-based platform designed to address the growing problem of construction and demolition (C&D) waste.  
It enables structured categorization, visualization, and reuse planning for materials such as concrete, steel, bricks, and aggregates.

The goal is to support **sustainable construction**, **resource recovery**, and **data-driven decision making**.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- Construction and demolition waste accounts for **~30% of global solid waste**
- India generates **150+ million tonnes** of C&D waste annually
- Only **~1%** is currently recycled
- The market is expected to reach **$362.9B by 2033**

This project helps bridge the gap between waste generation and circular reuse.
