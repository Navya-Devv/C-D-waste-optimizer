# 🏗️ Sustainable Urban Construction Data Pipeline  
### Waste Prediction in the Indian Construction Sector

A hybrid, statistically grounded framework for predicting construction material wastage in data-scarce environments.

This project integrates limited real-world procurement data with controlled synthetic augmentation to enable exploratory modeling, benchmarking, and decision-support for sustainable construction planning.

---

## 🔍 The Problem

Construction projects in India lack standardized material wastage reporting.  
Sparse datasets limit reliable forecasting, optimization, and sustainability analysis.

---

## ⚙️ Our Approach

- Structured data cleaning with physical feasibility constraints  
- Bootstrap-based synthetic data augmentation with bounded Gaussian perturbation  
- Relevance-based extrapolation confidence metric  
- Material-specific XGBoost regression models  

**Materials Modeled:**
- Steel  
- Cement  
- Granite  
- Sand  
- Bricks  

---

## 📊 Key Highlights

- ~600–700 statistically consistent records per material  
- Non-linear waste modeling  
- Extrapolation reliability scoring  
- Lightweight decision-support architecture  

---

## 🏗️ Deployment Vision

Engineers input project parameters →  
Backend models predict:

- Waste percentage  
- Waste quantity  
- Scenario-based procurement insights  

Designed for proactive material optimization during early-stage planning.

---

## 🌍 Sustainability Impact

Aligned with **UN SDG-11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities)**  
Promotes resource efficiency and data-driven waste reduction in construction.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The dataset includes controlled synthetic augmentation and is intended for exploratory modeling and benchmarking — not deterministic forecasting.
